It’s that time again! I’m bringing back something from my old, regular blogging days of the mid-aughts: the Friday Random Ten. I don’t remember who started this tradition, but a bunch of us Philly bloggers would bring this around every Friday. The basic rules are:

1. fire up your digital music player
1. go to “all songs“ and shuffle play _everything_
1. note the first 10 songs to show up, _without_ skipping anything
1. create your playlist

**Today’s Friday Random Ten**, brought to you by realizing on Monday that you wrote this thing up on Friday and never pushed it live 🫠 So, can we make a little exception this week?

1. “Man with a Plan” &#8211; Tacks, the Boy Disaster, _Daytrotter Sessions: April 13, 2007_
2. “Take You on a Cruise” &#8211; Interpol, _Antics_
3. “The Final Countdown” &#8211; Europe, _The Final Countdown_
4. “Bottle Rocket” &#8211; The Go! Team, _Thunder Lightning Strike_
5. “Blood Patrol” &#8211; VLLNS ft. Powernerd, _Dreamhour_
6. “Don’t Forget Me” &#8211; Red Hot Chili Peppers, _By the Way_
7. “Flight 180” &#8211; Bishop Allen, _Daytrotter Sessions: June 1, 2007_
8. “One of my Terms” &#8211; Pink Floyd, _The Wall_
9. “Sick Again” &#8211; Led Zeppelin, _Physical Grafitti_
