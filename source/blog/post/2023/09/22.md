It’s that time again! I’m bringing back something from my old, regular blogging days of the mid-aughts: the Friday Random Ten. I don’t remember who started this tradition, but a bunch of us Philly bloggers would bring this around every Friday. The basic rules are:

1. fire up your digital music player
1. go to “all songs“ and shuffle play _everything_
1. note the first 10 songs to show up, _without_ skipping anything
1. create your playlist

**Today’s Friday Random Ten**, brought to you by me getting close to [my goal of 100 new-to-me horror movies by Halloween](https://letterboxd.com/reedcodes/list/100-horror-movies-in-92-days-2023/) _way_ too quickly.

1. “One Week” &#8212; Barenaked Ladies, _Stunt_
2. “Tragic Mirror” &#8212; Sondre Lerche, _Daytrotter Session: Jun 27, 2007_
3. “Kryptonite” &#8212; Three Doors Down, _Y100 Sonic Sessions, Vol. 4_
4. “Chasing Sirens” &#8212; Orgy, _Vapor Transmission_
5. “Medicine” &#8212; Luke Temple, _Daytrotter Session: Aug 27, 2007_
6. “No Gato” &#8212; _About_, _Daytrotter Session: Mar 5, 2007_
7. “Not Even Jail” &#8212; Interpol, _Antics_
8. “Red Queen” &#8212; Dr. Awkward, _Unlimited_
9. Mundane &#8212; Marc with a C, _Human Slushy_
10. “Mr. Jones” &#8212; Counting Crows, _August and Everything After_

**Artists I’ve seen live:** Barenaked Ladies, Dr. Awkward, Marc with a C

**Favorite track on the list:** “Mr. Jones”, because it is an album that came out when I was close to that [magical age of 14 when our musical selves are starting to cement](https://adolescentiaproject.com).

**Least favorite track on the list:** I am not in an Orgy mood today.

**Oh come one:** not only _three_ songs from Daytrotter Sessions, but two of them are back to back. Was I really once that into Daytrotter Sessions that I have that many of them on my player?
