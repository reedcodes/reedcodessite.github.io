It’s that time again! I’m bringing back something from my old, regular blogging days of the mid-aughts: the Friday Random Ten. I don’t remember who started this tradition, but a bunch of us Philly bloggers would bring this around every Friday. The basic rules are:

1. fire up your digital music player
1. go to “all songs“ and shuffle play _everything_
1. note the first 10 songs to show up, _without_ skipping anything
1. create your playlist

**Today’s Friday Random Ten**, brought to you by that feeling of confidence you get when you cross off a bunch of items on your to-do list.

1. “Cruel Minor Change” &#8212; Beulah, _The Coast is Never Clear_
2. “It’s No Game (Part 2)” &#8212; David Bowie, _Scary Monsters_
3. “Smarkatch” &#8212; Gogol Bordello, _Multi Kontra Culti vs. Irony_
4. “Reason to Believe” &#8212; Dashboard Confessional, _Dusk and Summer_
5. “Spin Spin Sugar” &#8212; Sneaker Pimps, _Becoming X_
6. “Out to Dry” &#8212; Live, _Birds of Pray_
7. “Wailing Wall” &#8212; Young Galaxy, _Daytrotter Session: July 12, 2007_
8. “I Don’t Know” &#8212; Beastie Boys, _Hello Nasty_
9. “Trendy” &#8212; Reel Big Fish, _Turn the Radio Off_
10. “The Defense” &#8212; Bad Religion, _The Process of Belief_

**Artists I’ve seen live:** Gogol Bordello, Beastie Boys, Reel Big Fish

**Favorite track on the list:** “Spin Spin Sugar”, although my old brain was _convinced_ this came out while I was in high school, but no. It was my freshman year of college.

**Least favorite track on the list:** I have nothing against Dashboard Confessional &#8212; I just am not a fan as much as I am other bands &#8212; so sadly it falls to “Reason to Believe” today.
