I am a principal web developer in Philadelphia PA, specializing in accessible websites using instrinsic design and modern CSS techniques. I hold a master's degree in [Communication, Culture, and Technology](https://cct.georgetown.edu/) from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at Georgetown University, focusing on popular media and horror studies. I also serve as the Secretary on the [Board of Directors at WPCampus](https://www.wpcampus.org/governance/board/).

My pronouns are they/them/theirs. My 2005 iPod still gets a lot of use. I've travelled a loop around the country via train, and [I drove the entirety of the historic Lincoln Highway](https://lincolnhighwayjournal.com/) in October and November 2022. I knit socks but I also have a bunch of unfinished sweaters. I enjoy tea and coffee equally, and I miss singing in a competitive karaoke league.

I've been a developer for over 25 years, and I've recently told my imposter syndrome to eff off and I've started speaking at conferences. Within my graduate program, I've branched out from web development and explored other passions, critically examining horror media with regard to abuse, oppression, and underrepresentation.
