Does it count meeting my blogging goal if my third post is about how I’m feeling with not quite meeting my blogging goal?

I started feeling sick on New Year's Day, and tested positive for covid-19 the next morning. I’ve spent the entire year so far, sick. Sometimes, there is only so much to do while sick _and_ still try to recover. As much as I want to get back to “normal”, my body reminded me of its boundaries when I tried. Just a walk two blocks up the street completely wiped me and I slept about 12 hours.

This isn’t a post so much about covid as it is me being frustrated. I’d still like to keep my “three posts a month” goal for the year, but I’d like to be more realistic, especially given how I’ve been this month. If I can do at least _one_ post per month, I’d feel accomplished!

Some things I’d like to write about:

- neat things I’m coding at work
- trying to meal plan for the first time
- my obvious first attempts at crochet
- saving up for a new sewing machine
- getting involved in professional organizations
- celebrating my bun’s first birthday

I’m still working hard to get over my imposter syndrome. I came across a blog post called [7 reasons why I don't write](https://mxb.dev/blog/seven-reasons-why-i-dont-write/) and it really does help to know that other people’s brains tell them similar things.

So I’ll keep going.
