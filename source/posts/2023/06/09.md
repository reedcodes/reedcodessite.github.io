Last Saturday, I went to the farmers market for the first time this season, and as I was walking into our apartment building, I heard some folks in the lobby talking about an estate sale. I asked about it, and they told me where it was. I dropped off my groceries, told my wife I wanted to check it out “just to see”, and headed out.

Dear reader, let me tell you. The living room held a lot of the usual things &#8212; china sets, books of varying subjects, knick knacks. Then I made my way into the bedroom, where I immediately fell in love. There, in the corner, was a vintage secretary dresser in amazing condition.

I say “vintage” because it seems to have been made in mid-last-century, yet is a reproduction of an antique piece. It’s got four drawers, and when you open the desk top, there are so many neat little nooks and secret hiding spots! And I got the thing for under $200.

It needs a good dusting and a nice polish, but overall, it is _gorgeous_. I would like to take more photos when it’s all cleaned up and in its proper space in the apartment.

I have wanted something like this since I was an early teenager, so nearly all my life. I am still reeling.
