It’s that time again! I’m bringing back something from my old, regular blogging days of the mid-aughts: the Friday Random Ten. I don’t remember who started this tradition, but a bunch of us Philly bloggers would bring this around every Friday. The basic rules are:

1. fire up your digital music player
1. go to “all songs“ and shuffle play _everything_
1. note the first 10 songs to show up, _without_ skipping anything
1. create your playlist

**Today’s Friday Random Ten**, brought to you by my anxiety on flying for the first time in almost four years, so I can attend this year’s [PCA/ACA annual conference](https://pcaaca.org/conference/2023/).

1. “The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face” &#8211; Johnny Cash, _American IV: The Man Comes Around_
2. “Swear” &#8211; Moby, _Hotel: Amient_
3. “Hermione’s Song (You & Me)” &#8211; Oliver Boyd and the Rememberalls, _Welcome to Wizard Rock_
4. “Everyone” &#8211; Van Morrison, _Moondance_
5. “Country Grammar” &#8211; Nelly, _Farmclub.com: Live and Unreleased_
6. “Extra Ordinary” &#8211; Better Than Ezra, _Closer_
7. “Milk & Honey” &#8211; Beck, _Midnite Vultures_
8. “Taxi” &#8211; Harry Chapin, _Heads & Tales_
9. “Story of a Lonely Guy” &#8211; Blink 182, _Take Off Your Pants and Jacket_
10. “Brena” &#8211; A Perfect Circle, _Mer de Noms_

**Artists I’ve seen live:** Moby, Oliver Boyd and the Rememberalls, Better Than Ezra, Beck, Blink 182.

**Favorite track on the list:** it’s actually kinda difficult this week, but... I’ll go with “Country Grammar”.

**Least favorite track on the list:** another tough one to pick as this playlist is pretty solid. Hmm. Maybe “Swear” since I’m not quite feeling intrumentals today.

**Serendipitous:** tracks from _Hotel: Ambient_ came up last week and this week.

**Problematic:** I absolutely still love wizard rock, and going to those shows (and putting one on myself!) fills me with happy nostalgia. However, fuck J.K.
