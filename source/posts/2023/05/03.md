This is 100% absolutely not new, but I havenâ€™t blogged about this _at all_, or even updated the site to announce this!

This year, WPCampus moved from one director to a Board of Directors model, allowing Rachel Cherry to step back from being responsible for the whole of the organization. She opened a call for nominations, and while I was interested, my imposter syndrome kicked in (again) and told me not to apply. However, to my surprise, I was nominated by someone else!

In early January, I was voted into the Board, and assumed the officer role of Secretary. Itâ€™s an exciting time! Itâ€™s been a few months, and Iâ€™m settling into my role. [The entire board is an amazing group of people](https://www.wpcampus.org/governance/board/), and I am so honored and proud to be serving with them.

Oh, and as a little plug, join us in [New Orleans this July for the 2023 conference](https://2023.wpcampus.org/)! As if Iâ€™m not busy enough ðŸ˜…, Iâ€™m also on the planning committee, acting as the attendee and registration coordinator. Tulane University, here we come!
