It’s that time again! I’m bringing back something from my old, regular blogging days of the mid-aughts: the Friday Random Ten. I don’t remember who started this tradition, but a bunch of us Philly bloggers would bring this around every Friday. The basic rules are:

1. fire up your digital music player
1. go to “all songs“ and shuffle play _everything_
1. note the first 10 songs to show up, _without_ skipping anything
1. create your playlist

**Today’s Friday Random Ten**, brought to you by 

1. “Breakdown (bonus track)” &#8211; GrooveWorthy, _The 80’s Dream Compilation Tape, Volume 2_
2. “Time” &#8211; Hootie & the Blowfish, _Cracked Rear View_
3. “NY-San Anton” &#8211; The Ladybug Transistor, _Daytrotter Session: SXSW (Jun 6, 2007)_
4. “Cecilia” &#8211; Simon & Garfunkel, _Simon & Garfunkel's Greatest Hits_
5. “Come Undone” &#8211; Duran Duran, _Duran Duran (The Wedding Album)_
6. “New Horizons” &#8211; Timecop1983, _Reflections_
7. “The Great Gig in the Sky” &#8211; Pink Floyd, _Dark Side of the Moon_
8. “Welcome to My Room” &#8211; Vietnam, _Daytrotter Session: Jan 14, 2007_
9. “First Tube” &#8211; Phish, _Y100 Sonic Sessions, Volume 5_
10. “Invincible” &#8211; Muse, _Black Holes and Revelations_

**Artists I’ve seen live:** Duran Duran, Muse

**Stuff I’ve kinda seen live, but no, not really:** pretty sure it doesn’t count as “live” by watching _The Wizard of Oz_ while _Dark Side of the Moon_ plays.

**Favorite track on the list:** this playlist could be a banger if put into a proper order, so this is difficult. Call it: GrooveWorthy, since I’m feeling the retrowave vibe today. (see also Timecop1983)

**Least favorite track on the list:** uuuuuuuuh. 🤔 Phish? Maybe? but not really?
