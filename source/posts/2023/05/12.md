It’s that time again! I’m bringing back something from my old, regular blogging days of the mid-aughts: the Friday Random Ten. I don’t remember who started this tradition, but a bunch of us Philly bloggers would bring this around every Friday. The basic rules are:

1. fire up your digital music player
1. go to “all songs“ and shuffle play _everything_
1. note the first 10 songs to show up, _without_ skipping anything
1. create your playlist

**Today’s Friday Random Ten**, brought to you by other folks joining the party! Thomas Rigby [posted a list today as well](https://thomasrigby.com/posts/friday-random-10-for-2023-05-12/). I’m glad others are having fun too.

1. “Down Payment Blues” &#8211; AC/DC, _Powerage_
2. “Kid A” &#8211; Radiohead, _Kid A_
3. “Sunny Day Suicide” &#8211; Chlorophyll, _Y100’s Philly File_
4. “I Could Die for You” &#8211; Red Hot Chili Peppers, _By the Way_
5. “Twice as Hard” &#8211; The Black Crowes, _Shake Your Money Maker_
6. “My Last Song” &#8211; Schaffer the Darklord, _Mark of the Beast_
7. “God Moving over the Face of the Waters” &#8211; Moby, _MobySongs: 1993 - 1998_
8. “6 Underground” &#8211; Sneaker Pimps, _Becoming X_
9. “The Gloaming (Softly Open Our Mouths in the Cold)” &#8211; Radiohead, _Hail to the Thief_
10. “I’m Gonna Love You Just a Little More, Baby” &#8211; Barry White, _The Ultimate Collection_

**Artists I’ve seen live:** Moby, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Schaffer the Darklord

**Favorite track on the list:** gonna go with “6 Underground”, but “Twice as Hard” comes in a close second. High school nostalgia coming in hard this week.

**Least favorite track on the list:** can I go with both Radiohead songs? Imma say yes, because it’s my music, my playlist, my rules.

**Problematic:** Moby 😒 because he was so creeping on Natalie Portman back in the day. Gross.

**Whelp, I’m not going to the Good Place:** yes, RHCP used to be my favorite band, and I have seen them multiple times. Sometimes traveling as far as nearly 250 miles from my home.

**Serendipitous:** two Radiohead songs in one playlist? Out of over 11k songs?

**Serendipitous but not really serendipitous:** RHCP showed up last week, and here they are again. But considering they used to be my favorite band, I’m not too surprised.
