It’s that time again! I’m bringing back something from my old, regular blogging days of the mid-aughts: the Friday Random Ten. I don’t remember who started this tradition, but a bunch of us Philly bloggers would bring this around every Friday. The basic rules are:

1. fire up your digital music player
1. go to “all songs“ and shuffle play _everything_
1. note the first 10 songs to show up, _without_ skipping anything
1. create your playlist

**Today’s Friday Random Ten**, brought to you by missing last week’s 10 because [I was presenting at a conference](https://pcaaca.org/conference/2023/).

1. “Closer to Free” &#8211; The Bodeans, _Go Slow Down_
2. “The Crystal Ship” &#8211; The Doors, _The Doors_
3. “DOUBLEDISC” &#8211; ToadOfSky, _STARWRLD_
4. “Auf Achse” &#8211; Franz Ferdinand, _Franz Ferdinand_
5. “Spreading Wings” &#8211; Gabriel Yared, _City of Angels: Music from the Motion Picture_
6. “I Want to Break Free” &#8211; The Protomen, _Present: a Night of Queen_
7. “Achilles Last Stand” &#8211; Led Zeppelin, _Presence_
8. “Mother, Stop Being Ridiculous” &#8211; Draco and the Malfoys, _Party Like You're Evil!_
9. “I Know Things Now” &#8211; Original Cast Recording, _Into the Woods_
10. “Genesis” &#8211; Zombie Hyperdrive, _Hyperion_

**Artists I’ve seen live:** Draco and the Malfoys, The Protomen, ToadOfSky

**Stuff I’ve kinda seen live:** I didn’t see _this_ production of _Into the Woods_, but I have seen quite a few various productions over the years, both professional and community theater.

**Favorite track on the list:** probably “I Want to Break Free” because witnessing The Protomen do an entire show of Queen covers was 100% amazing. But also: “DOUBLEDISC” because I can’t not favorite my brother’s music.

**Least favorite track on the list:** “Achilles Last Stand” as I am _not_ in a Led Zeppelin mood today.

**Problematic:** I absolutely still love wizard rock, and going to those shows (and putting one on myself!) fills me with happy nostalgia. However, fuck J.K.
