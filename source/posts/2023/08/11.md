It’s that time again! I’m bringing back something from my old, regular blogging days of the mid-aughts: the Friday Random Ten. I don’t remember who started this tradition, but a bunch of us Philly bloggers would bring this around every Friday. The basic rules are:

1. fire up your digital music player
1. go to “all songs“ and shuffle play _everything_
1. note the first 10 songs to show up, _without_ skipping anything
1. create your playlist

**Today’s Friday Random Ten**, brought to you by me actually being kinda relieved that my karaoke team didn’t make it to city-wide finals.

1. “Return to Zero” &#8212; Let Em Riot, _The 80’s Dream Compilation Tape, Volume 2_
2. “Love for All Seasons” &#8212; Christina Aguilera, _Christina Aguilera_
3. “Spin the Wink” &#8212; The Velvet Teen, _Daytrotter Session: Jan 22, 2007_
4. “Love Me Two Times” &#8212; The Doors, _Strange Days_
5. “Battle Cry” &#8212; The Broadcast, _From the Horizon_
6. “That’s My Bush” &#8212; _That’s My Bush_ television series theme song
7. “Kiss Eternal” &#8212; Lords of Acid, _Farstucker_
8. “The Brews” &#8212; NOFX, _Punk in Drublic_
9. “Medicine Head” &#8212; Marc with a C, _Pop Pop Pop_
10. “Galapagos” &#8212; Smashing Pumpkins, _Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness_

**Artists I’ve seen live:** NOFX, Marc with a C

**Favorite track on the list:** _Pop Pop Pop_ is one of my favorite albums from Marc, so I’m going with “Medicine Head”

**Least favorite track on the list:** possibly “Love Me Two Times”, not because I have anything against The Doors, per se, but because I went really big into them during the summer between senior year and heading to college, and my boyfriend at the time was really big into them. Yeah, I know.

**Serendipitous:** two songs played back to back, in which the title of its album is a [spoonerism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoonerism).
