(TODO: replace image)

Over the past few months, I've accomplished things I never thought I would. I graduated Georgetown University with a master's degree in Communication, Culture & Technology. I spoke at a professional conference in-person for the first time. I drove to San Francisco and then travelled the historic Lincoln Highway all the way to New York &#8212; by myself!

While I have [a website for my road trip](https://www.lincolnhighwayjournal.com/) that sorely needs to be updated, there are other things I want to write about: coding techniques I used on that blog, my knitting, neat projects I'm doing at work. Stuff like that. When I saw a challenge to [Bring Back Blogging](https://bringback.blog/), I saw this as a sign to add a place on this site to write up my thoughts on various topics. My goal (and it is a goal, not a resolution) is to write at least three blog posts in January. That's all the challenge calls for! I can do that.

I would very much like to get back into writing. In my grad program, I remembered just how much I love to write, and how little I do it anymore. Some of that is imposter syndrome; my brain tells me that not only has someone already said it, but that I would be seen as incompetent for only learning about it just now. However, I heard recently (was it someone at [the most recent HighEdWeb](https://events.highedweb.org/heweb22)?) that even if someone may have said something already, learning is always good, and by me writing about it, someone _else_ may also learn something new.

My goal is <abbr>SMART</abbr>: specific, measureable, attaintable, relevant, and time-based. I have a bullet list of topics and a place to expand on them. So here's to writing at least three posts in January!
